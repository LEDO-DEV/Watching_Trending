    <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p class="lead">Your privacy is important to us. At Watching Trending, we collect only the data we need to operate our site, improve your experience, and communicate with you. We are committed to transparency and will never sell your personal data.</p>

    <h3>Information We Collect</h3>
    <p>We gather information in a few key ways to enhance our services:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Analytics Data:</strong> We collect aggregated, non-identifying information about website traffic, such as which pages are most popular, how long visitors stay, and what devices they use. This helps us understand our audience and improve content. We use a privacy-focused analytics tool that does not track individual users across sites.</li>
      <li><strong>Contact Information:</strong> When you submit a message through our contact form or subscribe to our newsletter, we collect the information you provide, such as your name and email address. This is used solely to respond to your inquiries or send you the content you requested.</li>
      <li><strong>Technical Data:</strong> Like most websites, our servers may log basic technical information, such as your IP address and browser type, for security and troubleshooting purposes. This data is not linked to your personal identity and is regularly purged.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How We Use Your Data</h3>
    <p>We use the data we collect to analyze content performance, improve site navigation, and respond to your messages. All information is stored securely on servers with industry-standard protections. We retain your data only as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected or as required by law.</p>

    <h3>Cookies and Tracking</h3>
    <p>We aim to keep cookie usage to a minimum. Our site may use a small number of essential cookies for basic functionality. Some embedded third-party services, such as video players or social media feeds, may set their own cookies. You have full control over cookies in your browser settings and can choose to block or delete them at any time.</p>

    <h3>Third-Party Links</h3>
    <p>Our articles often link to external websites, including our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61581864767234" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook page</a> and other sources. Their privacy practices may differ from ours. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any third-party sites you visit before sharing your information.</p>

    <h3>Your Data Rights</h3>
    <p>You have the right to manage your personal information. You may request access to, correction of, or deletion of your data at any time by reaching out to us via our <a href="contact.html">Contact</a> page. We will respond to all requests promptly and in accordance with applicable data protection laws.</p>

    <h3>Policy Updates</h3>
    <p>We may update this policy periodically to reflect changes in our services or legal requirements. We will note the date of the latest revision below. We encourage you to review this page occasionally to stay informed. Last updated: 2025-10-17.</p>
