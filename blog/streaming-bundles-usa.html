      <p>After a decade of unbundling, Americans face a new problem: subscription sprawl. The average US household now subscribes to 4-6 streaming services, spending $50-80 monthly on entertainment. Families juggle multiple services to watch sports, prestige TV, and local news, often forgetting which show lives on which platform. In 2025, the industry is swinging back toward bundles that look a lot like cable‚Äîonly smarter, cheaper, and increasingly ad‚Äësupported.</p>

      <h2>Why Bundles Are Back</h2>
      <p>The return to bundling isn't just nostalgia‚Äîit's driven by real consumer pain points and economic realities:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Churn Fatigue:</strong> Consumers are tired of constantly subscribing and unsubscribing. The average streaming subscriber cancels 2-3 services per year, only to re-subscribe later. Bundles reduce this decision friction by offering multiple services at a discount.</li>
        <li><strong>Ad-Tier Economics:</strong> Ad-supported video on demand (AVOD) and Free Ad-Supported Television (FAST) inventory allows services to fund lower subscription prices while maintaining healthy average revenue per user (ARPU). Netflix's ad tier, for example, generates more revenue per subscriber than its standard plan.</li>
        <li><strong>Sports Rights Consolidation:</strong> Live sports remain the last appointment television, anchoring massive audiences. As rights costs soar, services are finding it more economical to share costs through partnerships and bundles rather than compete for exclusive deals.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What It Means for Marketers and Creators</h2>
      <p>Ad-supported bundles dramatically expand advertising inventory, but they also raise the creative bar. With viewers accustomed to premium, ad-free experiences, performance now depends on thumb-stopping hooks, audio-first messaging for mobile viewing, and sophisticated contextual targeting that respects user privacy. Content creators benefit from new syndication opportunities across FAST channels and curated hubs, but must adapt their content for different viewing contexts and ad loads.</p>

      <h2>How to Plan Your Media Mix</h2>
      <p>Smart marketers are already adapting their strategies for the bundle era:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Balance Reach with Intent:</strong> Use FAST channels for broad reach and brand awareness, while maintaining targeted campaigns on search and social platforms for high-intent audiences.</li>
        <li><strong>Format for Context:</strong> Create short-form cutdowns that map to each placement's sound requirements and aspect ratio. A 30-second TV spot needs a different hook than a 6-second mobile pre-roll.</li>
        <li><strong>Measure Holistically:</strong> Move beyond last-click attribution. Use lift studies, brand surveys, and modeled conversions to understand the full customer journey across bundled touchpoints.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>The Road Ahead</h2>
      <p>As streaming bundles mature, expect to see more sophisticated targeting, better measurement tools, and potentially new pricing models that blend subscription and advertising revenue. The winners will be services that can balance user experience with advertiser value, creating sustainable economics for the post-cable era.</p>
